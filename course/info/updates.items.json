We hope you\u2019re as excited as we are to get started learning, sharing, designing, and building! \n<p />We\u2019ve divided the course into six concepts, each of which we expect to take about a week to complete but you are welcome to work at your own pace and on your own schedule. A suggested schedule is included in the Syllabus. \n<p />In addition to videos and questions to answer, the course includes a series of hands-on activities and online simulations that will allow you to more actively experiment with structures. A list of recommended supplies for the hands-on activities is <a href=\"https://studio.edx.org/asset-v1:DartmouthX+DART.ENGS.01.X+2015_T2+type@asset+block/C1_ActivityKitSupplies.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">available here</a>; we\u2019ve tried to focus on easy-to-find materials but you are always welcome to improvise. \n<p />We\u2019re looking forward to learning about structures from around the world, so please share images of structures from your communities. \n<p />Where do you start?  \n<ol>\n  <li>Go to the Courseware tab and begin at <a href=\"https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:DartmouthX+DART.ENGS.01.X+2015_T2/courseware/4d10cd4ee67248c98551afbf563c91e4/710f1f9fa50540c79947bb82efe134aa/\" target=\"_blank\">Start Here.</a> Watch the Course Tour and take our <a href=\"https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:DartmouthX+DART.ENGS.01.X+2015_T2/courseware/4d10cd4ee67248c98551afbf563c91e4/350e038a67ea4829968aa2daada625fb/\" target=\"_blank\">Course Survey</a>.</li>\n<li>Review the <a href=\"https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:DartmouthX+DART.ENGS.01.X+2015_T2/0f2332a395864d9fb070406fcfc76c3b/\" target=\"_blank\">Syllabus</a>, linked at the top of the course, to find out information on the learning goals and objectives, course team, course schedule, Certificate track, grading, and policies on discussions. </li>\n  <li>Move on to Concept 1 and start at the <a href=\"https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:DartmouthX+DART.ENGS.01.X+2015_T2/courseware/724b2f67e55c427d87bec78e5baf99ee/6f8f4725bbcd45b7ada54d9d5029ae8b/\" target=\"_blank\">Course Introduction</a>.</li>\n  </ol>\n<p />The focus of Concept 1 is engineering design, a process we\u2019ll apply throughout the course.

Thank you for sharing. If you haven\u2019t jumped into the course yet, it is not too late. Remember you can always work at your own pace and on your own schedule. The only deadline is that if you are on the Certificate track you will need to complete all required activities by June 19th 13:00 UTC.\n<p />Many people tackled the marshmallow challenge and cardboard chair project this past week, neither of which is easy but I hope you had fun. We saw lots of great towers and attempts at towers. Cardboard chair designs included one with storage compartments, several designed for comfort, and some that were stools. Which was your favorite design?

What is tension? What is a funicular form? What is the difference between a cable-stayed bridge and a suspension bridge? These are just a few of the questions that we\u2019ll explore this week. We\u2019ve also made Concept 3 available for those of you who are ready to move forward. \n<p />The hands-on activity for the week is to build a model of a cable-stayed bridge. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what types of tower designs and cable arrangements you choose for your bridges. If you don\u2019t have time to build a full model of a cable-stayed bridge you can always sketch a design or build a small-scale prototype.\n<p />If you haven\u2019t already done so, please remember to take the <a href=\"https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:DartmouthX+DART.ENGS.01.X+2015_T2/courseware/4d10cd4ee67248c98551afbf563c91e4/350e038a67ea4829968aa2daada625fb/\" target=\"_blank\">Course Survey</a>.\n<p />Keep sharing and building -\n<p />Vicki and the entire ENGSx team\n<p />\n<table width=\"98%\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\">\n      <tr>\n        <td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"><strong>A few edX tips from the course team:</strong>\n        <p />Please look for the 'Topic Area' drop down menu when creating a New Post so that you are placing your post in the correct topic.

The course will remain open indefinitely so feel free to work at your own pace. The Verified Certificate option has re-opened for those of you who are interested (sign-up before June 12th).\n<p /> This week we are going to put tension and compression together to form trusses and tensegrity sculptures. Kenneth Snelson, a sculptor, was one of the first to build using tensegrity, a term that was coined by Buckminster Fuller. Tensegrity is a great visual example of tension and compression working together. I hope you&rsquo;ll try building a few tensegrity sculptures and trusses of your own.\n<p />This past week we enjoyed seeing all of the anti-funicular forms that you built using cheesecloth, paper mache, paper towels, and other materials - keep improvising. Thin anti-funicular forms are surprisingly strong so be sure to push on or load your forms.\n<p /> Concept 5 is available for those who are ready to tackle shear and bending in beams.

If you are following the suggested schedule you will be starting Concept 6 today. The course officially ends on June 19th so if you wish to receive a certificate you will need to complete the required activities by that date. We plan to keep the course open, however, so as long as you are not worried about a certificate you are welcome to work at your own pace.</p>\n<p>This week we are going to put the pieces together to look at the Overall Response of Structures, buildings in particular. How do buildings respond to wind loading and earthquakes? What types of systems are used to resist horizontal loads in a building? Is a stiffer, stronger system necessarily better? These are a few of the questions we&rsquo;ll explore.</p>\n<p>This past week lots of people built beams and shelves out of cardboard, paper, foamcore and a range of other materials. This next week, in addition to two smaller-scale activities that I hope will help you better understand building response, we encourage you to extend your shelf design to build a table or return to the cardboard chair activity to see if you can improve your design now that you&rsquo;ve learned a bit about structures. </p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Please complete the <a href=\"https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:DartmouthX+DART.ENGS.01.X+2015_T2/courseware/92f9cbbc253a455882a2f901494329f9/1c64d1918df642f0a821c54fade203ed/\" target=\"_blank\">End of Course Survey</a> available through edX to help us improve the course. </strong></p>\n<p>Remember that the course will remain open indefinitely so feel free to work at your own pace. <strong> Certificate tracks (honor code and Verified) need to have all work completed by June 19th 13:00 UTC to receive a grade.</strong></p>\n<p><strong><br />\n  </strong>\nHave fun -</p>\nVicki and the entire ENGSx team\n<p />\n<img src=\"http://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:DartmouthX+DART.ENGS.01.X+2015_T2+type@asset+block@courseteam.jpg\" width=\"300\" />\n<p />",

We saw lots of great models of lateral force resisting systems built out a cardboard, popsicle sticks, erector set parts, and more. We also asked students to build tables out of cardboard or other materials of their choice. A table is really a small-scale structure since it must support both vertical and lateral loads. Check out the images posted on the discussion board of tables built by others in the class. </p>\n<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-81aaf53f-fd11-0e55-3878-30ff66d71b7d\"><strong><br />\n</strong></span>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The Engineering of Structures Around Us officially ends on Friday, June 19th.</strong> If you wish to receive a certificate (Honor Code or Verified) you will need to earn a total passing grade of 60% by that date.
