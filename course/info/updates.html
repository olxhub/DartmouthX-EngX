<section><article><h2>July 13, 2015</h2>Congratulations! On Friday July 10th edX emailed honor-code and Verified Certificates. 

If you have a question or did not get a certificate and believe you should, please post in Discussion in the "CERTIFICATE FAQ" pinned thread.  Be sure to check your spam folder as sometimes edX emails will go into Junk/Spam.

</article><article><h2>June 26, 2015</h2><strong>hi everyone!
The course has gone into Archive mode. This means that technically the course is 'over' and no more certificates or grades will be issues. Course Staff and Instructor will no longer be monitoring the discussions.
However - we are leaving the course open for anyone to go through at their own pace. We are still seeing activity in the discussion boards - that is great! Have fun and still share!</strong></article><article><h2>June 16, 2015</h2><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

<p dir="ltr">This past week we asked students to create models to help them understand how structures respond to lateral motions due primarily to wind and earthquakes. We saw lots of great models of lateral force resisting systems built out a cardboard, popsicle sticks, erector set parts, and more. We also asked students to build tables out of cardboard or other materials of their choice. A table is really a small-scale structure since it must support both vertical and lateral loads. Check out the images posted on the discussion board of tables built by others in the class. </p>

<p>Welcome to week 6 of The Engineering of Structures Around Us. If you are following the suggested schedule you will be starting Concept 6 today. The course officially ends on June 19th so if you wish to receive a certificate you will need to complete the required activities by that date. We plan to keep the course open, however, so as long as you are not worried about a certificate you are welcome to work at your own pace.</p>
<p>This week we are going to put the pieces together to look at the Overall Response of Structures, buildings in particular. How do buildings respond to wind loading and earthquakes? What types of systems are used to resist horizontal loads in a building? Is a stiffer, stronger system necessarily better? These are a few of the questions we&rsquo;ll explore.</p>
<p>This past week lots of people built beams and shelves out of cardboard, paper, foamcore and a range of other materials. This next week, in addition to two smaller-scale activities that I hope will help you better understand building response, we encourage you to extend your shelf design to build a table or return to the cardboard chair activity to see if you can improve your design now that you&rsquo;ve learned a bit about structures. </p>

<p />Welcome to week 5 of <em>The Engineering of Structures Around Us</em>. We continue to be amazed at the structures you are sharing and building. Lots of people tackled the tensegrity sculpture and truss building activities. Check out images shared by others using the <em><strong>Visual Discussion too</strong></em><strong><em>l</em></strong>, which you can access through the course menu. 
<br />
<p dir="ltr">This week we are going to look at beams. Beams resist tension and compression as well as shear through bending. Beams are everywhere: in tables, shelves, buildings, bridges, machinery, and many more places. Where can you find beams in your world? Can you build a beam or a shelf?</p>
<br />
<p dir="ltr">Concept 6 is available for those who are ready to put everything together and consider the Overall Response of Structures. </p>
<br />
<p dir="ltr">Remember that the course will remain open indefinitely so feel free to work at your own pace. <strong> Certificate tracks (honor code and Verified) need to have all work completed by June 19th 13:00 UTC to receive a grade.</strong></p>

<p /><p />Welcome to <em>The Engineering of Structures Around Us</em> whether you are just starting or are ready to jump into week 4. The course will remain open indefinitely so feel free to work at your own pace. The Verified Certificate option has re-opened for those of you who are interested (sign-up before June 12th).
<p /> This week we are going to put tension and compression together to form trusses and tensegrity sculptures. Kenneth Snelson, a sculptor, was one of the first to build using tensegrity, a term that was coined by Buckminster Fuller. Tensegrity is a great visual example of tension and compression working together. I hope you&rsquo;ll try building a few tensegrity sculptures and trusses of your own.
<p />This past week we enjoyed seeing all of the anti-funicular forms that you built using cheesecloth, paper mache, paper towels, and other materials - keep improvising. Thin anti-funicular forms are surprisingly strong so be sure to push on or load your forms.
<p /> Concept 5 is available for those who are ready to tackle shear and bending in beams. And the Reflections from Week 3 video is now posted. <br />
<p dir="ltr">Check out the <em><strong>new Visual Discussion tool</strong></em> to navigate through collections of images shared throughout the course. You can find it at the top of the course menu on the left.</p>

<p>I saw lots of great cable-stayed bridge designs this past week: using one tower and multiple towers, curved and straight roadways, fan and harp cable arrangements, and much more. Be sure to check out the designs and vote for your favorites. <br />
</p>
<p>This week we&rsquo;ll explore compression and the elements of structures that resist compression including columns, arches, vaults, domes and anti-funicular forms. So start looking for structures around you that resist compression. We&rsquo;ll also make Concept 4 available later today for those of you who are ready to put tension and compression together to form trusses and tensegrity sculptures.</p>
The main hands-on activity for the week is to build an anti-funicular form using cheesecloth and plaster (alternative materials include paper towels, fabric, and flour). The activity can get a bit messy but results in beautiful forms. If you don&rsquo;t have time to build an anti-funicular form you can sketch one.
<p>Be sure to share your designs as we love seeing them and hearing about what worked and what didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>Keep sharing and building, </p>

<p /><p />Wow, the structures that people are posting from all around the world are amazing! Thank you for sharing. If you haven’t jumped into the course yet, it is not too late. Remember you can always work at your own pace and on your own schedule. The only deadline is that if you are on the Certificate track you will need to complete all required activities by June 19th 13:00 UTC.
<p />Many people tackled the marshmallow challenge and cardboard chair project this past week, neither of which is easy but I hope you had fun. We saw lots of great towers and attempts at towers. Cardboard chair designs included one with storage compartments, several designed for comfort, and some that were stools. Which was your favorite design? You can vote for different posts by clicking on the vote button. 
<p /><h3>Watch the <a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:DartmouthX+DART.ENGS.01.X+2015_T2/courseware/7cc049df96854e028d24851c5c1d3d83/966eb412cb7b4082a8037e8b590fc156/1">Reflections From Week 1 video clip </a>where I highlight a few posts.</h3>
<p />This week we’ll focus on Concept 2 and explore tension and the elements of structures that resist tension. What is tension? What is a funicular form? What is the difference between a cable-stayed bridge and a suspension bridge? These are just a few of the questions that we’ll explore this week. We’ve also made Concept 3 available for those of you who are ready to move forward. 
<p />The hands-on activity for the week is to build a model of a cable-stayed bridge. I’m looking forward to seeing what types of tower designs and cable arrangements you choose for your bridges. If you don’t have time to build a full model of a cable-stayed bridge you can always sketch a design or build a small-scale prototype.
<p />If you haven’t already done so, please remember to take the <a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:DartmouthX+DART.ENGS.01.X+2015_T2/courseware/4d10cd4ee67248c98551afbf563c91e4/350e038a67ea4829968aa2daada625fb/" target="_blank">Course Survey</a>.

<h1>Welcome to The Engineering of Structures Around Us!</h1>
<p /><strong>The Engineering of Structures Around Us (DART.ENGS.01.X)</strong> has officially begun. We hope you’re as excited as we are to get started learning, sharing, designing, and building! 
<p />We’ve divided the course into six concepts, each of which we expect to take about a week to complete but you are welcome to work at your own pace and on your own schedule. A suggested schedule is included in the Syllabus. 
<p />In addition to videos and questions to answer, the course includes a series of hands-on activities and online simulations that will allow you to more actively experiment with structures. A list of recommended supplies for the hands-on activities is <a href="https://studio.edx.org/asset-v1:DartmouthX+DART.ENGS.01.X+2015_T2+type@asset+block/C1_ActivityKitSupplies.pdf" target="_blank">available here</a>; we’ve tried to focus on easy-to-find materials but you are always welcome to improvise. 
<p />We’re looking forward to learning about structures from around the world, so please share images of structures from your communities. 
<p />Where do you start?  
<ol>
  <li>Go to the Courseware tab and begin at <a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:DartmouthX+DART.ENGS.01.X+2015_T2/courseware/4d10cd4ee67248c98551afbf563c91e4/710f1f9fa50540c79947bb82efe134aa/" target="_blank">Start Here.</a> Watch the Course Tour and take our <a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:DartmouthX+DART.ENGS.01.X+2015_T2/courseware/4d10cd4ee67248c98551afbf563c91e4/350e038a67ea4829968aa2daada625fb/" target="_blank">Course Survey</a>.</li>
