<p>Report your observations in the discussion. Don't forget to post pictures or a short video of your lateral force resisting structures, we'd love to see how you experimented! And we encourage you to view and comment on each others' posts.</p>
<p>Here are a few questions we hope you'll consider as you design and build&nbsp;and experiment with your lateral force resisting structures.</p>
<ul>
<li>What did you use to build your lateral force resisting systems?</li>
<li>Which system is the stiffest, meaning that it deflects the least: &nbsp;a moment-resisting frame, a &nbsp;braced frame or a shearwall?</li>
<li>Which system is the most flexible, meaning that it deflects the most: a moment-resisting frame, a braced frame or a shearwall?</li>
<li>Which system is the strongest: a moment-resisting frame, a braced frame, or a shearwall?</li>
</ul>
