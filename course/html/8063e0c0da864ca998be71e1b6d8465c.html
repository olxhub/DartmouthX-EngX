<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Explore: Trusses</strong></span></p>
<p>Use the beam simulator to experiment with trusses. Where in the truss are the forces the highest? Where is tension and compression? How do the results change as you change the height, span and loading on the truss? Have fun!</p>
<p><strong>Here's a starting point for you:</strong> Design a Howe Truss that has a span of 40m and a height of 8m. Apply a load of 120kN at the center of the bridge. Answer the first 3 Finding questions found under the simulation. These will give you a good base to build from.</p>
<p>After answering the 3 Finding questions, explore more questions such as:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">Change the span of the bridge. How do the forces change as the span changes?</span></li>
<li>Change the height of the bridge. How do the forces change as the height changes?</li>
<li>Instead of applying a single point load at the center of the bridge, apply 3 equal point loads. How are the forces in the members of the truss affected?</li>
<li>Change to a Pratt Truss. How does this affect the forces in the members? Pay close attention to the forces in the diagonal and vertical members.</li>
</ol>

<li>Use the pull-down menus to select Truss Form, Applied Load, and Load Distribution.</li>
<li>Click and drag the circle to slide the values of Truss Span and Truss Height.</li>
<li>Note that red = compression, blue = tension, and the load is shown with green arrows.</li>
<li>Force values are shown on the left side and a negative number denotes a compressive force and a positive number denotes a tensile force.</li>
