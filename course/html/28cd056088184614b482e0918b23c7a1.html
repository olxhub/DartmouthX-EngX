<p><span style="color: #000000;">Use this simulation to explore columns. When you click on 'calculate load' the simulator will tell you how much load your column can support before it fails in either compression or by buckling.</span><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><br /></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Here's the design challenge</span>: Design a column to support the greatest amount of load, while using the least amount of material. Maximize the load while minimizing the volume of the column, which is a function of the base diameter and height.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Use the Guiding Questions and Findings questions to help you think about what to change and observe as you experiment.</span></p>
<p><span color="#ff00ff" style="color: #000000;">Guiding Questions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">How does the height of a column affect the amount of load that it can support before failing? Select one type of material and cross-sectional shape and then adjust the height. What happens to the amount of load the column is able to support?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li>How do columns of different heights fail? In compression or in buckling? As you experiment with height notice if the column fails in compression or in buckling.</li>
<li>How does the material choice affect how much load a column can support? Select one cross-sectional shape and height and then adjust the material. How does the material type affect the amount of load that the column is able to support?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Click and drag the circle on the slider bars to change the Base Diameter and Length (or height) or the column.</li>
<li>Click the drop-down menu to see the materials and cross-section options. Click on the option to select it.</li>
<li>Click the Calculate Load button to see if the column has buckled or failed in compression! You'll also get some data.</li>
