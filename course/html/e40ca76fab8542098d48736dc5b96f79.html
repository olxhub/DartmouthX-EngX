<p>Welcome to <em>The Engineering of Structures Around Us</em>! Through this course we hope to introduce you to a few engineering concepts related to structures. We'll focus mainly on bridges and buildings but 'structures' also include trees, furniture, and most solid objects. We hope you'll come away from the course with a different perspective on the structures around you.</p>
<p>We believe that you'll gain a deeper understanding of structures by building so we've included a series of hands-on activities in the course. We've tried to focus on activities that use easy-to-find materials but feel free to improvise. Here is a list of recommended supplies so you can get started gathering them:&nbsp;<a href="/static/C1_ActivityKitSupplies.pdf" target="[object Object]">Recommended Supplies for the Activities</a>&nbsp;(PDF)</p>
<p>Have fun! <em>Vicki and the rest of the ENGSx team</em></p>

<p><strong>In this course you'll learn:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>how and why structures (including structures in the natural and biological world) were designed and constructed the way they wereâ€‹.</li>
<li>to conceptually design and build prototypes of structures.</li>
<li>that engineering goes beyond math and science and involves much creativity and innovation.</li>
<li>to identify and compare structural elements, forms, and systems.</li>
<li>to describe the loads expected on a structure and the resulting flow of forces through the structure.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Through this course, you&nbsp;will:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>apply the engineering design process to build innovative structural systems such as cardboard chairs, models of cable-stayed bridges, and tensegrity sculptures.</li>
<li>learn about funicular forms and how ropes and cables resist tension.</li>
<li>discuss how columns, arches, and anti-funicular forms resist compression.</li>
<li>discover how trusses, beams and walls resist loads.</li>
<li>sketch the flow of forces through a structure.</li>
<li>compare and contrast different structural forms and systems to answer a range of questions such as:</li>
<ul>
<li>Why might an engineer choose a beam over a truss?</li>
<li>How do the dimensions of a structure affect its response?</li>
<li>How do engineers choose forms and systems to create structures that are both elegant and functional?</li>
</ul>
</ul>
