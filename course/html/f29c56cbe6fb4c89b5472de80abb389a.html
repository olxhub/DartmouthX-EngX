<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Explore: Beams&nbsp;Part II</strong></span></p>
<p>Let continue to experiment with the Beam Simulator. Now you get to choose the material and cross-sectional shape in addition to the load, span and type of beam; as you vary these different options pay attention to the size of the beam required to support the load. Can you minimize the size and area of the beam cross-section that is required, while maximizing the load the may be supported?</p>
<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s again start</strong> with a simply-supported beam with a span of 10m that supports a distributed load of 50kN/m. We found earlier that the maximum shear was at the supports, while the maximum bending moment was at the middle of the beam.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After answering the 2 Finding questions, explore more questions such as:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">Select a material type and cross-sectional shape and size and determine the size of the cross-section that is required.</span></li>
<li>Try changing the material type. What happens to the size of the required cross-section?</li>
<li>Try changing the cross-sectional shape. How does the shape affect the size of the cross-section?</li>
<li>Have fun experimenting! What is the most load your beam is able to support? Share your loading value and design with the class through the discussion board.</li>
</ol>

<li>Click and drag the circles to slide the values of Length, Load, Load Point, and Support.</li>
<li>Note, the color of the load arrows is not relevant and is not color-coded to tension or compression.</li>
<li>Use the 'Loading' drop-down menu to choose a Concentrated load or Distributed load.</li>
<li>Use the drop-down menus on the right side to choose a Material and Beam Cross-Section</li>
<li>Shear and Moment values are shown on the left side. Also watch the visualization of the shear and moment diagrams.</li>
