To add the exercise or tool in an IFrame, replace the URL in the example tool below with the URL of the page that contains the exercise or tool that you want. Note that the URL must start with https instead of http so that the IFrame will appear in all browsers. You must also replace the value of the title attribute with text that describes the external content. This text is not visible, but can be accessed by screen reader users.
