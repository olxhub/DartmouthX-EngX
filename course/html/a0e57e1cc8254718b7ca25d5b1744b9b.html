<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Build: Columns</strong></span></p>
<p>Before we dig into the details of columns, we'd like you to experiment with 'columns' that you find and create yourself. Through this process, we hope you'll discover and feel how different columns behave. Here are a few questions we hope you'll consider as you experiment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is a taller column able to carry more load than a shorter column?</li>
<li>How does the type of material affect the amount of load that may be applied to the column?</li>
<li>How do columns fail?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>After you've experimented a bit with columns, watch the <em>Lesson</em> on columns.</p>
