<ul style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 25.6000003814697px;">
<ul>
<li>What was your design philosophy for your freestanding structure? Did you use all of the materials allowed?</li>
<li>What was innovative about your design?</li>
<li>How much time did you spend brainstorming and sketching? testing and building?</li>
<li>How tall was your structure? (include a numeric input so we can easily figure out the average height? and max height?)</li>
<li>How could you increase the height of your structure? If you could do the marshmallow challenge again, what would you do differently?</li>
