<p>Report your observations in the discussion. Don't forget to post pictures or a short video of your antifunicular forms, we'd love to see it! We encourage you to view and comment on each others' posts.</p>
<p>Here are a few questions we hope you'll consider as you design and build your anti-funicular forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>What was the inspiration for the anti-funicular form you chose?</li>
<li>What is creative about your design? Did you include holes in the cheesecloth? How many support points did you use?</li>
<li>What part of the anti-funicular form that you built resists compression? &nbsp;tension?</li>
<li>How much load can your anti-funicular form support? How did you support the base when you loaded your anti-funicular form?</li>
</ul>
