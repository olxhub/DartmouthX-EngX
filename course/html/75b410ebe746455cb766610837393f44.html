<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lesson: Shear and Bending</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In this lesson we'll explore beams. How is a beam different from and similar to elements that we've already studied? Where in a beam do shear, tension, and compression occur? How do we support beams? These are a few of the questions we'll consider.</span></p>
