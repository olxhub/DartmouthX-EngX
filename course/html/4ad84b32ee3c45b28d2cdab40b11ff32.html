<p>Use each concept's "general discussion" for questions and thoughts about the activities, videos, simulations, etc. during the week. We'll monitor this board for big questions that get voted up and share our own thoughts on the weekly concepts. Look for our fabulous teaching assistants (TAs) in discussion!</p>
<p>Do remember there are separate discussions for Share Your World and any building activities. Look for them in the respective sections or go to the main <a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:DartmouthX+DART.ENGS.01.X+2015_T2/discussion/forum" target="_blank">Discussion </a>area to find all the different topics for each concept.</p>
