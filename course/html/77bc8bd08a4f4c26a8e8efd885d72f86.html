<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">Explore: Arches</span></span></strong></p>
<p>Use this simulation to explore arches. As you adjust the height (or depth) of the arch, span (or length) of the arch, and load applied to the arch, how is the compressive force in the arch affected? What implications does this have on the design of arches?<strong> <br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Design Challenge:</strong>Can you create an arch that supports a large load while minimizing the compressive force in the arch?</p>
<p>Use the Guiding Questions and Findings Questions to help you think about what to change and observe as you play with the simulation.</p>
<p><strong>Guiding Questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As the height increases, what happens to the compressive forces and reaction forces?</li>
<li>As the span increases,what happens to the compressive forces and reaction forces?</li>
<li>As the load increases,what happens to the compressive forces and reaction forces?</li>
</ul>
