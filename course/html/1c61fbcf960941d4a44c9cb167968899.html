<p>Report your observations in the discussion. Don't forget to post pictures or a short video of your tensegrity sculpture, we'd love to see it! And we encourage you to view and comment on each others' posts.</p>
<p>Here are a few questions we hope you'll consider as you design and build your tensegrity sculptures:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many dowels and elastic bands did you use to build your tensegrity structure(s)?</li>
<li>As you push on your tensegrity structure, what happens? You should find that tensegrity structures are fairly flexible, meaning that they can deform quite a bit. What are some of the advantages and disadvantages of a more flexible structure?</li>
<li>What was the inspiration for your design?</li>
<li>What part of the tensegrity structure resists tension? What part of the tensegrity structure resists compression?</li>
</ul>
