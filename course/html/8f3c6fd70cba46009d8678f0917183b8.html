<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Explore: Single Degree of Freedom&nbsp;(SDOF) Systems</strong></span></p>
<p>Using this simulation, explore how buildings tend to want to respond and move. We're using a simple single-degree of freedom model but it can tell you a lot about how a building will respond to lateral motions such as wind and earthquakes. How does the height of the model affect the response? How does the mass of the model affect the response?</p>
<p>Here's a starting point for you: create a single-degree of freedom (SDOF) system using a steel column that is 15m long with a cross-sectional width of 30cm and support a mass of 10,000kg.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the frequency of this SDOF system?</li>
<li>What happens to the frequency if you now change the height of the column? or the material? or the cross-section?</li>
</ol>
