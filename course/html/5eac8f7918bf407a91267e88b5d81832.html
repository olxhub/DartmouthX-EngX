<p>Report your observations in the discussion. Don't forget to post pictures or a short video of your bridge design, we'd love to see it!</p>
<p>Here are a few questions we hope you'll consider as you design and build your cable-stayed bridge:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">Tackle some of these questions in the discussion with your coursemates. Can you answer these questions for yourself by the end of your explorations?</span></li>
<li>What shape did you use for the tower(s)? Did you use a single tower or multiple towers? Where did you place your towers: to one side or spanning both sides?If you tried loading your bridge, how did you load it and how much load was it able to support?</li>
<li>How many cables did you use? Did you use a fan or harp design for your cables? Why?</li>
<li>What was the inspiration for you design?</li>
<li>If you could re-design your cable-stayed bridge, what would you change?</li>
</ul>
