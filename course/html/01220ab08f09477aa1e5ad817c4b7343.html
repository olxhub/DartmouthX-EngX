<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lesson: Engineering and Architecture</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A common question that I get from students is "What is the difference between engineering and architecture?" There is no easy answer to this question. In this video <a href="http://www.kawiaka.com/" target="_blank">Karolina Kawiaka</a>, an architect and lecturer here at Dartmouth, and Tim Eliassen, an engineer and the founder and president of <a href="http://www.tripyramid.com" target="_blank">TriPyramid Structures, Inc.</a>&nbsp; share a few of their thoughts on the differences and similarities between engineering and architecture and how engineers and architects collaborate on projects.</span></p>
