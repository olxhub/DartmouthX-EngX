<p>Report your observations in the discussion. Don't forget to post pictures or a short video of your truss bridges. We'd love to see them! We encourage you to view and comment on each others' posts.</p>
<p>Here are a few questions we hope you'll consider as you design and build your truss bridges:</p>
<ul>
<li>What type of truss did you design? why? how many truss members did you use?</li>
<li>How much load was your truss able to support? How did it fail?</li>
<li>How did you build the joints of your truss?</li>
<li>Which members of your truss do you expect to be in tension? compression?</li>
<li>How could you improve your design?</li>
</ul>
