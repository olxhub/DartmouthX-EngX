<p>Report your observations in the discussion. Don't forget to post pictures or a short video of your cardboard table or design, we'd love to see it! And we encourage you to view and comment on each others' posts.</p>
<p>Here are a few questions we hope you'll consider as you design and build your cardboard table:</p>
<ul>
<li>What was the inspiration for your design?</li>
<li>What part of your table&nbsp;resists tension? What part of table resists compression?</li>
<li>How did you support the table and why?</li>
</ul>
