<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lesson: Tensegrity</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">What is a tensegrity structure? Why are tensegrity structures and sculptures different from other structures? How are the loads transferred through these structures? Where do we find tension and compression? These are a few of the questions we'll explore in this lesson.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #000000;">The Tensegrity section has only this one item, the Lesson video. The Tensegrity building activity is found on the left main menu.</span></em></p>
