<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lesson: Shear and&nbsp;Bending Stress</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Shear forces and bending moments results in stresses, which engineers compare with allowable material stresses to ensure that beams are able to support the required loads. In this lesson we'll learn how to calculate shear stresses and bending stresses.</span></p>
