<h1>Posting and Sharing Images in Discussion</h1>
<p>You'll be asked to share images from your community and images/videos of your building activities in Discussion. There are two main ways to attach or embed an image into a discussion post. Both start with clicking the 'image icon' and choosing to link or choosing to upload/attach.</p>
<p><img src="http://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:DartmouthX+DART.ENGS.01.X+2015_T2+type@asset+block@icon_insertimage.png" alt="Screenshot of Insert Image" width="400" /> <img src="http://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:DartmouthX+DART.ENGS.01.X+2015_T2+type@asset+block@Icon_linkembed.png" alt="Screenshot of Insert Image" width="400" />
</p>
<p><u><strong>Method 1: Linking and Embedding</strong></u></p>
<p>If your image is posted online somewhere else you can link to it and embed it in the post. This will bring the image into the post and be seen without clicking on the link. Pretty neat! Be sure you have the URL of *image* itself. It will have a .jpg or .png at the end of the web address.</p>
<p>To get the URL of an image:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Right-click the image to get the contextual menu. If you on a Mac and do not have &quot;right-click&quot; enabled you can do a &quot;right-click&quot; by holding down the Ctrl key and doing a regular &quot;click&quot; or tap.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>From this menu you can get the URL of the image itself! Here is what to look for in that contextual menu depending on which browser you are using. Some of the wording might different, but look for something similar as below:<br />
  Chrome: Copy image URL<br />
  Safari: Copy image address<br />
  Internet Explorer: Properties &gt; Copy the URL address shown<br />
  Firefox: Copy image location<br />
  <br />
  </li>
  <li>Test it! Paste that URL into your web browser and it should take you to JUST the image itself in your browser and you will see a .jpg or .png at the end of that web address<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Paste THAT web address into the Insert Image field in edX.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Before you close the original website you got the image URL from, please note the source of the image and type that information into your discussion post! We want to promote 'good practice' of giving appropriate credit and source information for images you find online.</li>
</ol>
<p><u><strong>Method 2: Uploading and Attaching</strong></u></p>
<p>You can directly upload and attach an image to a discussion post. There is a 10MB limit! </p>
<p><strong>REMINDER: DO NOT UPLOAD IMAGES THAT DO NOT BELONG TO YOU.</strong> 
Meaning, please do not download images from the web and then upload to edX without permission. Any images that are not yours, that you might find online and link/embed in your post, you MUST list the source credit and the original web address of where you found the image. This is good practice and gives credit where due!</p>

<h1>Image Annotation and Sharing Resources</h1>
</p>
<p>In Share Your World we'll be asking you to share images of structures in your community or on your travels. As you go through each concept, you'll learn more about how forces flow through structures. To take the Share Your World a step further, we'll be asking you to draw the flow of forces on your images.</p>
<p>Here is an example (our course's header graphic):</p>
<p><img src="http://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:DartmouthX+DART.ENGS.01.X+2015_T2+type@asset+block@DART.ENGS.01.X_Thumbnail.jpg" alt="Kurilpa Bridge source Alastair Smith from Flickr" width="600" /></p>
<p>Some of you may not have software to draw on images. Below are a few suggestions of online tools and free downloads that can enable you to participate in drawing the flow of forces and share images. <em>We do not endorse nor represent any of these tools/software/sites, please use at your own risk. Some of these sites are heavy with advertising.</em></p>
<p>If you have difficulty with sharing images or drawing on your own images, please post in Discussion! Use the 'A Course FAQ' forum!</p>
