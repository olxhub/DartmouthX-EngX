<p><strong>Concept 3: Compression Glossary</strong></p>
<p><strong>anti-funicular form:</strong> the form taken by a structure under a given set of loads such that the entire structures is in compression</p>
<p><strong>arch:</strong> a (usually) curved form that spans an open space </p>
<p><strong>buckling load:</strong> a compressive load that causes a column to displace laterally</p>
<p> <strong>compression:</strong> &ldquo;pushing&rdquo; force on a member that causes it to shorten or buckle </p>
<p><strong>compression failure:</strong> a crushing or yielding failure that occurs when the applied stress exceeds the allowable stress of the material</p>
<p> <strong>compressive stress (&#963;):</strong> stress caused by a pushing force over a given area described by &#963; = P/A where P is compressive load and A is the cross-sectional area</p>
<p><strong>column:</strong> a vertical member that primarily resists compressive forces</p>
<p> <strong>crush:</strong> break apart by compression </p>
<p><strong>dome:</strong> a structural element created by rotating an arch around its vertical axis</p>
<p> <strong>failure:</strong> failure occurs when a structure or device has been used past the limits of design that inhibits proper function </p>
<p><strong>funicular form:</strong> the form taken by a cable or rope under any given loa</p>
<p> <strong>load:</strong> a force that is applied to a structure such as weight, wind, snow, etc. </p>
<p><strong>modulus of elasticity (E): </strong>is a material property that measures an object&rsquo;s resistance to being deformed elastically (non-permanently)</p>
<p> <strong>moment (M):</strong> the tendency of a force to cause an object to rotate or bend described a M = F*d where F is the force applied and d is the distance from the fixed axis <br />
</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>moment of inertia (I):</strong> a measure of the resistance to bending or buckling of a cross-section</p>
<p dir="ltr"> <strong>reaction: </strong>a force exerted by a support on an object </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>span:</strong> the distance an object covers from end to end without support</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>stress:</strong> internal distribution of force</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>tension:</strong> &ldquo;pulling&quot; force on a member that causes it to elongate </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>yield:</strong> deform permanently</p>
<p dir="ltr"> <strong>vault:</strong> an extended arch that spans an open space</p>
