    <td colspan="2"><p><strong>anti-funicular form:</strong> <br />
      the form taken by a structure under a given set of loads such that the entire structures is in compression</p>

      a (usually) curved form that spans an open space </p>
      <p><strong>buckling load (P</strong>cr)<strong>:</strong> <br />
      a compressive load that causes a column to displace laterally</p>
      <p> <strong>compression:</strong> <br />
      &ldquo;pushing&rdquo; force on a member that causes it to shorten or buckle </p>
      <p><strong>compression failure:</strong> <br />
      a crushing or yielding failure that occurs when the applied stress exceeds the allowable stress of the material</p>
      <p> <strong>compressive stress (&#963;):</strong><br /> 
      stress caused by a pushing force over a given area described by &#963; = P/A where P is compressive load and A is the cross-sectional area</p>
      <p><strong>column:</strong> <br />
      a vertical member that primarily resists compressive forces</p>
      <p> <strong>crush:</strong> <br />
      break apart by compression </p>
      <p><strong>dome:</strong> <br />
      a structural element created by rotating an arch around its vertical axis</p>
      <p> <strong>failure:</strong> <br />
      failure occurs when a structure or device has been used past the limits of design that inhibits proper function </p>
      <p><strong>funicular form:</strong><br /> 
      the form taken by a cable or rope under any given load</p>
      <p> <strong>load:</strong> <br />
      a force that is applied to a structure such as weight, wind, snow, etc. </p>
      <p><strong>modulus of elasticity (E): <br />
      </strong>is a material property that measures an object&rsquo;s resistance to being deformed elastically (non-permanently)</p>
      <p> <strong>moment (M):</strong> <br />
        the tendency of a force to cause an object to rotate or bend described a M = F*d where F is the force applied and d is the distance from the fixed axis <br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>moment of inertia (I):</strong> <br />
      a measure of the resistance to bending or buckling of a cross-section</p>
