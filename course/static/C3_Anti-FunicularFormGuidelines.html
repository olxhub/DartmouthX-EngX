    <td align="left" valign="top"><p>Anti-funicular forms are very efficient for specific loading conditions. Engineers and architects including Heinz Isler, Felix Candela, and Antoni Gaudi regularly built anti-funicular forms to help guide their designs. Anti-funicular forms are primarily in compression so must they must be constructed of materials that are able to resist compression such as steel, concrete, or plaster. </p>
      <p><strong>Design Goal</strong>: <br />
      Design and build an anti-funicular form. What type of form do you wish to design? Will your form serve a certain purpose or do you just wish to experiment with different forms? Will your anti-funicular form be able to support loads? Maybe the load of a heavy book?</p>
    <p><strong>Supplies</strong>: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cheesecloth works best for anti-funicular forms but a lightweight fabric will also work; we typically use Grade 60 cheesecloth with a 32x28 thread count. If doing paper mache, you will need newspaper.</li>
      <li>Plaster of Paris, water, disposable mixing bowl or flour and water for paper mache. Plaster of Paris is available at most hardware and craft stores</li>
      <li>Tape</li>
      <li>String</li>

    Research different anti-funicular forms designed by Heinz Isler, Felix Candela, Antoni Gaudi and others. Or sketch designs of your own. What forms do you like? Why? Will your anti-funicular form include openings? How will it be supported? Will you apply additional loads?</td>

    <p>Step 1: Create an outline of your form. I find it easier to first draw it on paper.</p>
    <p><a href="http://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:DartmouthX+DART.ENGS.01.X+2015_T2+type@asset+block@C3_ActivityAntiFunicular_Step1Img1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:DartmouthX+DART.ENGS.01.X+2015_T2+type@asset+block@C3_ActivityAntiFunicular_Step1Img1.jpg" alt="Test and Reflect" width="500" /></a><br />

    <p>Step 2: Cut out your design in cheesecloth using your paper model as a guide.  </p>
    <p>Step 3: Tie strings at locations where you plan to hang your funicular form. Rather than trying to create holes in the cheesecloth I find it easier to simply tie the string around the corner of the cheesecloth. You’ll need to find some place to hang your funicular form: a drying rack or laundry basket or cardboard box work well. Be creative finding someplace to hang the form!</p>
    <p><a href="http://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:DartmouthX+DART.ENGS.01.X+2015_T2+type@asset+block@C3_ActivityAntiFunicular_Step3Img1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:DartmouthX+DART.ENGS.01.X+2015_T2+type@asset+block@C3_ActivityAntiFunicular_Step3Img1.jpg" width="300" alt="Test and Reflect" /></a><br />

    <p>Step 4: Mix up plaster or paper maché. I used a metal tray to mix the plaster but you could use a paper plate or different type of container.  Plaster shouldn’t be washed down the sink as it may clog pipes or drains.  When you’re done with this project, just scrape any leftover or dried plaster into the trash.  To make clean-up easier, mix the plaster in a plastic bag and throw it away as soon as you’re done.  Two recipes are given below. Always add water slowly while stirring and stop once the consistency is smooth.</p>
    <p>Plaster Recipe: ½ cup plaster, ¼ cup water  </p>
    <p>Paper Maché Recipe: ½ cup water, ½ cup flour (if you have it, add a tablespoon of white glue for a smoother finish)</p>
    <p>Step 5: Dip your funicular form in plaster.  Hang your funicular form by connecting the strings to whatever frame you’ve chosen – tape or binder clips work well to support the strings.</p>
    <p><a href="http://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:DartmouthX+DART.ENGS.01.X+2015_T2+type@asset+block@C3_ActivityAntiFunicular_Step5Img1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:DartmouthX+DART.ENGS.01.X+2015_T2+type@asset+block@C3_ActivityAntiFunicular_Step5Img1.jpg" alt="Test and Reflect" width="400" /></a><br />
      <em>Click image to enlarge</em>    </p>
    <p>Step 6: Once the plaster is dry, cut the strings, flip over your funicular form and voilà, an anti-funicular form.</p>
