<div class="detailed-solution">
<p>Explanation</p>

<p>If Owl stands closer to the edge of the diving board than the bending moment, which is maximal at the support closest to Owl, will increase. Bending moment is a function of the force (in this case the weight of Owl) and the distance (in this case the distance between Owl and the closest support). As the distance increases the moment will also increase.</p>
