    <choice correct="false">The force in these diagonal members will increase</choice>

    <choice correct="false">The force in these diagonal members will remain the same</choice>

<solution>
<div class="detailed-solution">
<p>Explanation</p>

<p>As the height increases the force in these diagonal members will decrease. Similarly to funicular forms, as the height increases, more of the force in the bar or truss member will resist the applied vertical loads.
