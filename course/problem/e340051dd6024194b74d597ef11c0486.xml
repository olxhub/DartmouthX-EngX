<solution>
<div class="detailed-solution">
<p>Explanation</p>

<p>If Owl carries a heavy load the bending moment will increase. Bending moment is a function of the force (in this case the weight of Owl and whatever Owl is carrying) and the distance (in this case the distance between Owl and the closest support). As the distance increases the moment will also increase.
