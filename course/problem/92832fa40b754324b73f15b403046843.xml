    <div class="detailed-solution">
      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>Owl designed and built a cable-stayed bridge. They are popular these days, so Iâ€™m not surprised. Owl decided to use a harp design, with all of the cables evenly spaced along the height of the tower; this made the calculations a bit easier since all of the cables were at the same angle. Owl could have also used a fan design for the cables, with all of the cable connected to the tower at a single point. Owl used both of the trees as towers but could have used a single tree/tower. Other options for bridges that use tension include a rope bridge and a suspension bridge but bridges of other types (beams, arches, trusses) are options as well. </p>
