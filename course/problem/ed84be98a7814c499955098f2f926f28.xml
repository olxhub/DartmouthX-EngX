  <p>An engineer is considering using a column with one of the cross-sections shown below, A or B. Assuming the cross-sections have the same total area and the mode of failure is expected to be buckling in both cases, which will make a stronger column?</p>

  <solution>
    <div class="detailed-solution">
      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>The hollow rectangular cross-section will have a higher moment of inertia since more of mass or area is further away from the center. Thus, column B will make the stronger column, assuming the column will buckle.</p>
