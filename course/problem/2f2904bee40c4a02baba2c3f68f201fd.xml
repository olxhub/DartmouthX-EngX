<p>Explanation</p>

<p>Positive and negative numbers signify the type of force. A compressive force is a negative number and a tensile force is a positive number. A negative number does not mean it's a smaller force, it only means it's a compressive force. As an example we can look at members AC and BD. AC shows a 75kN force and BD shows a -75kN force. They are both the same amount of force, 75kN, and AC is  tensile force (positive number) and BD is a compressive force (negative number).</p>
