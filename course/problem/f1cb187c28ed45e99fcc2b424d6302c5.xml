<p>Explanation</p>
<p> If you are on the Certificate Track, you will receive 1 point for completing the activity and sharing in discussion, as self-reported above.</p>
  <p> For the Certificate, you are asked to do 4 of the 7 hands-on activities listed in the Syllabus. A red X above means you have 0 points for this hands-on activity. When calculating the final grade, 3 of the lowest scores are dropped for the hands-on activities.</p>
<p>Having the information on your completion, intent, and limitations will help us with future activities in the course, even if you are not on the Certificate track. Thanks!</p>
