<div class="detailed-solution">
<p>Explanation</p>

<p>Using a hollow rectangular cross-section would result in more of the mass of the cross-section being further from the center. The hollow cross-section would have a higher moment of inertia and would be better able to resist bending and would thus has a smaller required cross-sectional area and volume.</p>
