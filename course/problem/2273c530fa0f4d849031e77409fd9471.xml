<p>Explanation</p>

<p>Beams and columns are the main elements used to resist vertical loads. Vertical loads are typically applied to the beams, which then transfer the loads to the columns and ultimately down to the ground. Shearwalls, braced frames, and moment-resisting frames are used primarily to resist lateral loads.</p>
