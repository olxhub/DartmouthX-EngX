<solution>
<div class="detailed-solution">
<p>Explanation</p>

<p>This truss is statically indeterminate since the number of unknowns is greater than the number of equations available. The number of unknowns = 3 unknown reaction forces (one at the roller connection, represented by an open circle, and two at the pinned connection, represented by an open triangle) plus 15 unknown bar forces (one unknown bar force per truss member) = 18 unknowns. The number of equations available to solve for these unknowns = 2*number of joints = 2*8 = 16 equations.
