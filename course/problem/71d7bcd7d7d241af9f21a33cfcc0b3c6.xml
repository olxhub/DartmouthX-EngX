    <choice correct="false">Member AB</choice>
    <choice correct="true">Member AC</choice>
    <choice correct="true">Member BC</choice>
    <choice correct="false">None of the members</choice>

<div class="detailed-solution">
<p>Explanation</p>

<p>I expect members AC and BC to be in compression. As you push down from above the diagonal members will shorten and the bottom member will elongate. Support B will roll to the right (away from A).
