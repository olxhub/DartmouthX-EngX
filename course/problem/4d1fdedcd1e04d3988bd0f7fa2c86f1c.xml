<solution>
<div class="detailed-solution">
<p>Explanation</p>

<p>The triangular structure will be able to resist a higher load. Triangular structures tend to be very stiff, meaning the deflections are very low, and strong, meaning they are able to resist a high load. A four bar structure with pinned connections will collapse under very little load.</p>
