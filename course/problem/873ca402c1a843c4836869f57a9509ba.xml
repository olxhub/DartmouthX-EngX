  <p>An engineer is considering using a column with one of the cross-sections shown below, A or B. Assuming the cross-sections have the same total cross-sectional area, which will make a stronger column assuming the column will fail by buckling?</p>

  <solution>
    <div class="detailed-solution">
      <p>Explanation</p>
      <p>The hollow cross-section will have a higher moment of inertia since more of the area is away from the center thus will carry a higher load. If the columns were to fail in compression both would be equally strong since the cross-sectional area is the same.</p>
