<p>Explanation</p>

<p> In this simulation the hollow section is the most efficient. By moving the area of the cross-section away from the center you get a higher moment of inertia thus more resistance to bending for less total area. It would be possible to design an i-beam that was as efficient or even more efficient but for this simulation the i-beam is less efficient.</p>
