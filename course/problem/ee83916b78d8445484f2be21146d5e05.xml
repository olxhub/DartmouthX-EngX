<p>Explanation</p>

<p>Wind and earthquake loads are typically classified as lateral or horizontal loads since the forces act horizontally (think about wind pushing on the side of a building). Earthquakes are a bit tougher to visualize but they also are typically classified as lateral forces since they cause shaking back and forth, which induce horizontal forces. Self-weight, traffic, and snow are usually classified as vertical loads since they act downward due to gravity.</p>
