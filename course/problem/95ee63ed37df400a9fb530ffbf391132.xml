<p>Explanation</p>

<p>When using the simulation, look at the colors of the segments and at the forces on the left side. The red beam AB has a force of 96kN, which is listed as -96kN since it's a compressive force. Now look at the blue beam AC and you can see it has a force of 75kN and is a positive number. This means it's a tensile force.</p>
