  <p>Design an arch with a height of 15m to span 100m and support a load 500kN/m. Determine the cross-sectional area required for the arch, given that the arch is made of a material with an allowable compressive stress of 1400kN/m<sup>2</sup>. Ignore self-weight and assume the arch fails in compression rather than buckling.</p>
